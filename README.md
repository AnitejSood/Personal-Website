# Personal-Website
Website using basic html and css with bootstrap and other things. testing out properties such as transitions etc. 
css contains some extra code for testimonials and services section, which can be added on later in the html code. I could have commented it out but i removed it from the 
html file but it will be there in the css file, will clean this project out more in the future.
